Lecture notes I took when attending math courses

* I did not take notes in all classes
* Sometimes I only made an index of covered topics
* I took all notes in real-time in class (mostly in SublimeText, sometimes vim)
* Since March 2019, all notes are taken with the Neo2 keyboard layout

cheers,
Lukas
